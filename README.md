**Description:** R Markdown is a tool that allows data scientists to combine code, outputs and text in a single place, facilitating more efficient and reproducible report preparation. The goal of this 1-hour workshop is to inspire R users, and R Markdown beginners, to explore features of R Markdown that transform basic documents into professional-quality reports that can be rendered to a range of final output types. The objectives of the workshop are to:

1. Give an overview of R Markdown as a tool for reproducible reporting and publishing
2. Review basics of combining code, outputs and formatted text in R Markdown
3. Introduce a number of quick tips and tricks to customize reports

Experience with R Markdown is not required. However, participants who want to follow along should have a recent version of RStudio installed (version > 1.4) - you can download the Desktop version of RStudio for free.
